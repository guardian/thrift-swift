thrift-swift
============

This repository exists so that the Thrift Swift library can be used with Swift Package Manager.  SPM requires that packages have a Package.swift file at the repository root, which is not possible with the multi-language structure of the main thrift repository.

The library readme is available [here](https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/swift/README.mdd)
